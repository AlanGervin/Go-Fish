# Go-Fish
 First attempt at me writing a version of the card game go-fish for python.
 
 I tried to use a toggle in the start of the main game loop which looking back
 was a bad way to advance the turn of players in the game. I also used almost
 similar code for the check_for_card and check_for_card_computer. I want to make
 that a single function moving forward and also plan on letting the user select
 how many players should be in the game and write a gameFunction that will allow
 the player and computer to select which opponent they are asking for what card.
